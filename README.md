### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey! My name is Tommy Shelby* I create some wacky projects when I have a need for it, and sometimes some projects might go unattended so please don't hold me to it. I also spend a lot of my times creating issues for my friends projects as well.

But besides all that, thanks for taking a gander at my GitHub and feel free to follow me or star any of my projects <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/738118274067464293.gif?v=1" width="20">

### What I'm working on:
- [Pterodactyl](https://github.com/tommyshelby9121/pterodactyl/blob/master)
    - This a discord bot that works with the pterodactyl panel api and ships with a built in panel for configuration and nothing but coolness.

\*Tommy Shelby is not my real name in any case whatsoever. It just a name I chose to use in one of the guilds I'm on active on which is [TheCodingDen](https://discord.gg/code) and it evolved into the name I am choosing to flow with for the time being.
